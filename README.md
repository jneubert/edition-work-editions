All editions of a work
======================

Use OCLC Linked Data services to get the OCLC numbers of all editions of a work via the
[WorldCat work id](http://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/linked-data/worldcat-entities/worldcat-work-entity.en.en.html)
linked to a particular edition's OCLC number.

An [early experimental procedure](https://github.com/jneubert/edition-work-editions/commit/e0c6a3f675feeaf67348c2d7a615dd2834a5fc79) has been developed as an outcome of the
[ELAG 2014 Hackathon using OCLC services](http://elag2014.org/programme/elag-2014-bootcamps/bootcamps-s-meyer/).

A larger experiment has been conducted in September 2014 with [100,000 oclc numbers[(../experiment-sep-2014/econbiz_oclc_numbers_100000.lst) from [EconBiz](http://econbiz.de), [randomly extracted](../experiment-sep-2014/random_econbiz_oclc_numbers.pl), [queried](../experiment-sep-2014/editions.pl) (resulting [data for all oclc](../experiment-sep-2014/all_oclc_editions_100000.json), [data for EconBiz](../experiment-sep-2014/econbiz_editions_100000.json)) and [evaluated](../experiment-sep-2014/interpret_editions.pl) ([result](../experiment-sep-2014/result_100000.txt)) with the code published here. See [Other editions of this work: An experiment with OCLC's LOD work identifiers](http://zbw.eu/labs/en/blog/other-editions-of-this-work-an-experiment-with-oclcs-lod-work-identifiers) on [ZBW Labs](http://zbw.eu/labs) for a description of the experiment and a discussion of its results.
